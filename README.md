# TVT19KMO Application
This is an application developed for Product Design and Development course.


### To start developing the app:
1. Clone this directory (prefer SSH)
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create a new branch `git checkout -b feature-name`
4. Run `npm run dev`
5. Start developing!
6. Create a pull request to main when you are done :).

### NPM commands:
* `npm run dev` - Starts development server (allows you to see changes in real-time)
* `npm run serve` - View production build locally.
* `npm run lint` - Lints (formats) the code based on some pre-defined code-styling rules.
* `npm run build` - Builds the project for development.

### Docs for developers:
* framework - [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
* tooling - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* styling - [TailwindCSS 2](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
* native tools - NativeScript (WIP)
